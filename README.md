**Here are my sample python scripts. Python version: 3.5.**

To run the code, you need to install **Python** and the following libraries: **matplotlib, numpy, scipy, PIL, pandas, bs4, sklearn, tensorflow**, etc. I suggest you to use **Anaconda** to manage the libraries.

**Contents:**

1. Basic python functions

2. Python scripts for mathematics: ODE solvers, eigensolvers, etc

3. Compute the ground state of the quantum many-body system (Ising model) using Matrix-Product-State algorithm

4. Compute the price of the European put option using the Black-Scholes model

5. Examples of data analysis using pandas library

6. My implementation of deep neural networks

7. Examples of machine learning using sklearn library

8. Examples of machine learning (neural network) using tensorflow library
